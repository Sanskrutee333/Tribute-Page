            Albert Einstein <b>14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955</b> was a German-born theoretical physicist,widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest and most influential physicists of all time.
            Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. 
            Relativity and quantum mechanics are the two pillars of modern physics.His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, 
            has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation".His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.
            Einstein always appeared to have a clear view of the problems of physics and the determination to solve them. 
            He had a strategy of his own and was able to visualize the main stages on the way to his goal. He regarded his major achievements as mere stepping-stones for the next advance.
            He received honorary doctorate degrees in science, medicine, and philosophy from several European and American universities.
